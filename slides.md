# What is Vue Storefront?

Vue Storefront is a versatile, open-source eCommerce Progressive Web Application (PWA) written in Vue.js. It is backend-agnostic, meaning it can connect to any eCommerce platform to serve as a frontend.
It is not just one product. **It provides an ecosystem of independent developer tools** adressing challenges that we will inevitably encounter when building an eCommerce storefront, such as:

- ✅ Building a scalable **Design System** with accessible components to keep consistency between different user interface elements.
- ✅ Building a fast and reliable **storefront** that delivers excellent User Experience to your customers.
- ✅ **Integrating third-party vendors** into your API orchestration and storefront.
- ✅ **Managing infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployments** to keep the application fast and reliable even under heavy loads.
- ✅ **Implementing engineering and architecture best practices** ensures that the project remains flexible and maintainable even on a large scale.

# Key Features

Vue Storefront is a versatile, open-source eCommerce Progressive Web Application (PWA) written in Vue.js. It is backend-agnostic, meaning it can connect to any eCommerce platform to serve as a frontend.

- [**Progressive Web App:**](https://ecommerce-platforms.com/ecommerce-reviews/vue-storefront-review) Vue Storefront is a PWA that behaves like a native mobile app in the browser, providing an immersive user experience.
- [**Offline Mode:**](https://ecommerce-platforms.com/ecommerce-reviews/vue-storefront-review) Users can access the native experience directly through their web browsers, even when offline.
- [**Community Support:**](https://vuestorefront.io/blog/quick-vue-storefront-getting-started-guide) Vue Storefront is a popular open-source project with a strong and growing community, which ensures constant updates and improvements.

<!--
Vue Storefront provides several key features that make it a popular choice for eCommerce development:

**Headless Architecture:** This means Vue Storefront can work with any backend eCommerce platform, providing a seamless frontend integration.<br>
**Progressive Web App:** Vue Storefront is built as a PWA, which means it behaves like a native app on mobile devices, providing an immersive user experience.<br>
**Offline Mode:** Vue Storefront can work offline, which means users can still browse products and add them to their cart even without an internet connection.<br>
**Community Support:** Being an open-source project, Vue Storefront has a large community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support for other developers.

# How it Works

Vue Storefront operates through three key concepts:

1. [**Vue Storefront Core:**](https://medium.com/the-vue-storefront-journal/introduction-to-vue-storefront-a-quick-getting-started-guide-d119023ed67d) This contains all the entry points, builds process, in-app libraries, and helpers.
2. [**Vue Storefront Modules:**](https://medium.com/the-vue-storefront-journal/introduction-to-vue-storefront-a-quick-getting-started-guide-d119023ed67d) These are the eCommerce features, such as cart, wishlist, catalog, and third-party integrations.
3. [**Vue Storefront Themes:**](https://medium.com/the-vue-storefront-journal/introduction-to-vue-storefront-a-quick-getting-started-guide-d119023ed67d) These are the actual shop implementations, allowing you to use and extend the logic from registered modules/core and add your own HTML markup and styles.

<!--
Vue Storefront works based on three main concepts:

**Vue Storefront Core:** This is the heart of the application, providing all the essential functionalities and libraries required to run the application.<br>
**Vue Storefront Modules:** These are specific features related to eCommerce, like the shopping cart, wishlist, product catalog, and third-party integrations.<br>
**Vue Storefront Themes:** These are the visual components of the application. They provide the HTML markup and styles that define the look and feel of the eCommerce site.

# Backend Connection

Vue Storefront can be connected with any eCommerce platform through [**vue-storefront-api**](https://vuestorefront.io/blog/quick-vue-storefront-getting-started-guide) and dedicated API connectors. This allows Vue Storefront to work with the backend platform, making it platform-agnostic.

<!--
Vue Storefront connects with the backend eCommerce platform using vue-storefront-api and dedicated API connectors. This allows Vue Storefront to pull data from the backend and display it on the frontend.

You can even customize its core components to meet your specific needs.

You can even customize its core components to meet your specific needs.

<!--
Using Vue Storefront provides several benefits:

**Better User Experience:** Because it's a PWA, Vue Storefront provides an app-like experience on mobile devices, improving the overall user experience.<br>
**Improved Performance:** PWAs are known for their speed and performance, which means your eCommerce site will load faster and provide a smoother browsing experience.<br>
